# Group project 
The Filmorate application should become a platform for communication and interaction between users. 
Added the ability to make friends, leave reviews and recommend movies to each other.
To help users navigate what is happening on the platform, we added an event feed. 
Plus, we added a search â€” by keyword from the title or description of the movie.
